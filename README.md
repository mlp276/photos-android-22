Search tags prompts:
Can you add a Search Tags button in top right corner of the home page. When this button is clicked, a drop down menu appears that allows you to choose between person and location tags. After one of those are selected, the user can type the name of the tag they are searching for and all photos that match the same tag name will appear. If there are no photos with that tag name, the page is empty.
When searching for tags, if there are no tags with the same name as the searched tag, do not close the app. Just say that "No photos have this tag"
